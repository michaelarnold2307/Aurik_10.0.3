"""
Adaptive Musical Noise Reduction DSP-Modul für Aurik 9.10 (SOTA-Maximum)

Implements principled musical noise artifact suppression using:
- Temporal-spectral variance tracking (Cohen 2002 approach)
- Autocorrelation-based periodicity detection for tonal artifact identification
- Noise-floor-modulated gain smoothing to prevent isolated spectral peaks
- Frequency-dependent smoothing (psychoacoustic: low freqs stronger, high gentler)
- Full NaN/Inf guards on all paths

Musical noise = isolated spectral peaks surviving after spectral subtraction/Wiener
filtering. These appear as short-lived, narrow-band tonal artifacts that are
perceptually annoying because they lack the temporal continuity of real music.
